# Walking-Sprite-In-Four-Directions
I expanded on the tutorial I used in my Running-Sprite-Animation Repository form Simplified Coding. I made a sprite that can walk up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys. I used a different sprite sheet than the one provided in the tutorial.

I also tried to find a sprite sheet with an idle position, but that proved difficult to find. So instead of an idle position, when the character stops moving I made the upward animation be it's default position when no keys are being pressed.

Here is a link to the tutorial:
